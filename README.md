# Final thoughts
- While ubiquitous language is important, the data didn't match css class names or the API endpints at times, so it is ignored. Typing is used instead to make the app state and data flow more sane.
- CSS has been kept the same for the most part with minimal changes.
- Could have used useReducer hook, but that IMO makes code more complicated, it's better to rather go with Redux in that case. Redux has not been used looking at the complexity of the application.
- Tests are skipped.
